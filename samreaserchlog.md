Hello World! Im Sam and i get the pleasure of sharing my journey through my english 235 class!

# Entry 1
  My name is Sam and this is a repository for my english 235 class. This is my third quarter attending at Peirce College, and I love it so far. I am able to attend here because I am enrolled in the Running Start program through my high school. By high school standards I am a junior. English is deffinitly not one of my strong suits what so ever so I apologize in advance for all of the many spelling errors that you will indeed see through out all of my entreys.
  
  My initial understanding of technical writing was that really boring text that you tend to eaither throw away right as you open something new or that huge booklet that you keep just incase but never actually look at ever agian. But I soon found out that i wasnt wrong i was just forgetting a huge part of technical writing which is litterly the explination to anything that you buy dowload... ect. which I had no idea
 
 When i followed along in the instructions provided by my professor it was very easy to create the needed text which in this case was the "Hello World". The instructions that are provivded are very easy to follow and made it very easy to make and meet all of the required things that we were told to have. with out the directions on how to create the page then it would have been very hard to do a good job when you are "flying blind"
 
 All of the websites so to speak that are mentioned in the propmt for this week were desined spacificly for the use by stunednts for the need that spacific information or for people who are intrested in the information that is provided on these sites. The purpose in makeing these websites is very smart because by using this format they make this information avalabe to anyone with internet access and a computer would be able to read this information.
 
 This week in class i have learned about the importance of technical writting in our daily lives. I had no idea that i use technical writting on a daily basis just to do simple things such as dowloading an app or even walking into the first day of class through things like the rubric that they give you when you walk into class. Technical writting is used every day and is very important when it comes to doing things new.
