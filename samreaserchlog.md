Hello World! Im Sam and i get the pleasure of sharing my journey through my english 235 class!

# Entry 1
  My name is Sam and this is a repository for my english 235 class. This is my third quarter attending at Peirce College, and I love it so far. I am able to attend here because I am enrolled in the Running Start program through my high school. By high school standards I am a junior. English is deffinitly not one of my strong suits what so ever so I apologize in advance for all of the many spelling errors that you will indeed see through out all of my entreys.
  
  My initial understanding of technical writing was that really boring text that you tend to eaither throw away right as you open something new or that huge booklet that you keep just incase but never actually look at ever agian. But I soon found out that i wasnt wrong i was just forgetting a huge part of technical writing which is litterly the explination to anything that you buy dowload... ect. which I had no idea
 
 When i followed along in the instructions provided by my professor it was very easy to create the needed text which in this case was the "Hello World". The instructions that are provivded are very easy to follow and made it very easy to make and meet all of the required things that we were told to have. with out the directions on how to create the page then it would have been very hard to do a good job when you are "flying blind"
 
 All of the websites so to speak that are mentioned in the propmt for this week were desined spacificly for the use by stunednts for the need that spacific information or for people who are intrested in the information that is provided on these sites. The purpose in makeing these websites is very smart because by using this format they make this information avalabe to anyone with internet access and a computer would be able to read this information.
 
 This week in class i have learned about the importance of technical writting in our daily lives. I had no idea that i use technical writting on a daily basis just to do simple things such as dowloading an app or even walking into the first day of class through things like the rubric that they give you when you walk into class. Technical writting is used every day and is very important when it comes to doing things new.

Hey World! Yes Its me agian comeing at you for the second week in a row (because this is a big part of my grade) this week in class we reall took Technical Writing to the next level. We made these home-made Lego sets And then created our own instructions acording to the steps that are required If you would like to check out my [Instructions](https://github.com/Sdetweiler320/ReaserchlogENG235.md/blob/master/LEGO%2BInstructions-Eng235.docx) that I made. After I made my set and my instructions we were given time in class to be able to meet with our class mates and actually be able to build each others sets and see what changes needed to be make to make them more user frendly and to see what we did well. I really enjoyed this because it allowed us to get first hand experence of someone testing out our products and then getting feed back about what we did well and what we need to improve on.

Some course outcomes that i feel like i really touched on this week is just being able to analyse feedback that a user gives us and then be able to transfer that feed back into our work and make it better, stronger and easier to use for any type of user that may stuble accross my product in one way or another. One of the more obvious ones would definitly be Being able to create our very own technical writting pices and then molding it so that it becomes useable for anybody to use.

In the past two weeks we have been focusing on course Outcome #3 ("Transform instructions") and Outcome 2 ("Information competency"), these transfer over to us using things like this website and learning to be able to write in mark down to make us more familar to these forms of media and writing. These two methods apply to course out comes 2 and 3 because when reading the how to's on writing in mark down we are actually doing what course outcome 2 wants us to be doing. we are taking information in the form of instructions and then using it to do things like write in mark down or build a LEGO set that one of my class amtes has made.

In class this week I was able to help multiple of my classmates with not only with their projects but also with some help with this website as well. with the help of another class mate i was able to upload the hyperlink above and then because of that i was able to help some other classmates with the same thing and it created a kind of domino effect with in the class.

In the next cuple weeks i am really excited to be able to start a big project in our class called the pierce hacker project and the reason that I am able excited is because I will be able to get into a class rutine and just be able to know exactly what i need to do everyday.

As a proffesor there is nothing that you can do to become a better proffesor, i think you are awesome!
