Hello World! Im Sam and i get the pleasure of sharing my journey through my english 235 class!

# Entry 1
  My name is Sam and this is a repository for my english 235 class. This is my third quarter attending at Peirce College, and I love it so far. I am able to attend here because I am enrolled in the Running Start program through my high school. By high school standards I am a junior. English is deffinitly not one of my strong suits what so ever so I apologize in advance for all of the many spelling errors that you will indeed see through out all of my entreys.
  
  My initial understanding of technical writing was that really boring text that you tend to eaither throw away right as you open something new or that huge booklet that you keep just incase but never actually look at ever agian. But I soon found out that i wasnt wrong i was just forgetting a huge part of technical writing which is litterly the explination to anything that you buy dowload... ect. which I had no idea
 
 When i followed along in the instructions provided by my professor it was very easy to create the needed text which in this case was the "Hello World". The instructions that are provivded are very easy to follow and made it very easy to make and meet all of the required things that we were told to have. with out the directions on how to create the page then it would have been very hard to do a good job when you are "flying blind"
 
 All of the websites so to speak that are mentioned in the propmt for this week were desined spacificly for the use by stunednts for the need that spacific information or for people who are intrested in the information that is provided on these sites. The purpose in makeing these websites is very smart because by using this format they make this information avalabe to anyone with internet access and a computer would be able to read this information.
 
 This week in class i have learned about the importance of technical writting in our daily lives. I had no idea that i use technical writting on a daily basis just to do simple things such as dowloading an app or even walking into the first day of class through things like the rubric that they give you when you walk into class. Technical writting is used every day and is very important when it comes to doing things new.

Hey World! Yes Its me agian comeing at you for the second week in a row (because this is a big part of my grade) this week in class we reall took Technical Writing to the next level. We made these home-made Lego sets And then created our own instructions acording to the steps that are required If you would like to check out my [Instructions](https://github.com/Sdetweiler320/ReaserchlogENG235.md/blob/master/LEGO%2BInstructions-Eng235.docx) that I made. After I made my set and my instructions we were given time in class to be able to meet with our class mates and actually be able to build each others sets and see what changes needed to be make to make them more user frendly and to see what we did well. I really enjoyed this because it allowed us to get first hand experence of someone testing out our products and then getting feed back about what we did well and what we need to improve on.

Some course outcomes that i feel like i really touched on this week is just being able to analyse feedback that a user gives us and then be able to transfer that feed back into our work and make it better, stronger and easier to use for any type of user that may stuble accross my product in one way or another. One of the more obvious ones would definitly be Being able to create our very own technical writting pices and then molding it so that it becomes useable for anybody to use.

In the past two weeks we have been focusing on course Outcome #3 ("Transform instructions") and Outcome 2 ("Information competency"), these transfer over to us using things like this website and learning to be able to write in mark down to make us more familar to these forms of media and writing. These two methods apply to course out comes 2 and 3 because when reading the how to's on writing in mark down we are actually doing what course outcome 2 wants us to be doing. we are taking information in the form of instructions and then using it to do things like write in mark down or build a LEGO set that one of my class amtes has made.

In class this week I was able to help multiple of my classmates with not only with their projects but also with some help with this website as well. with the help of another class mate i was able to upload the hyperlink above and then because of that i was able to help some other classmates with the same thing and it created a kind of domino effect with in the class.

In the next cuple weeks i am really excited to be able to start a big project in our class called the pierce hacker project and the reason that I am able excited is because I will be able to get into a class rutine and just be able to know exactly what i need to do everyday.

As a proffesor there is nothing that you can do to become a better proffesor, i think you are awesome!

# Entry 3
Throughout the week we worked on composing a survey that we plan to send out to a controlled portion of the student body at pierce college. A challenging part of composing the survey was that we had to transform all of everyone’s ideas into a real working survey. This required a lot of collaboration and I think that it went pretty well considering none of us had done hey survey to the scale before. Something that was interesting about this process is how everybody was so open to everybody else’s opinions and nobody got too defensive about protecting their idea which I thought was very cool but everybody was able to be so open minded.

The audience for the Pierce hacker project is any student who is wanting more information on how to do something that is part of the technological aspect of school. I think that you chose to deliver this project in the form of a public website so that anybody would be able to access it at any given time for any reason. When something is not As public as the Pierce Hacker project it causes students to have to jump through a lot more hoops to get the information they need. 

This week I learned how to use Google docs which is something that I have never used before in a collaborative way which was really cool.

# Entry 4
My process to drafting our analytical report was to go through the survey multiple times and pick out a few repetitive problems that students are having and focus on those rather than focusing on the smaller issues that students are having.

Everybody who read my draft seem to like it of course there was the minor changes that I needed to make to make it presentable but for the main report itself everybody who read it said that I did a fairly good job at getting the information that I needed to across the table in our you to open.

Between now and Monday I plan on fixing all those minor changes that I need to to make my draft presentable and finish everything that I need to.

This week I think I learned how to ride a analytical report. This is something that I have never done before and rather enjoyed learning how to do. I have never been asked to write an analytical report until now so I find that this information will help me in the future.

# Entry 5

My thoughts on the OER project are that it would be cool but for me personally I think it might be confusing at the start. I think that a good way to approach this would be in the same way that we approached the pierce hacker project in the sense that we just take it slow and do a little bit at a time so that we are able to produce quality work.

My thoughts on the peers hacker project is that it has gone very well so far and we should continue to produce the same quality of work and we will have a fully operational website in no time at all. If I were to take this route I wouldn’t do the same thing that I have been doing. Just take it slow and produce quality work.

My thoughts on the self design project are that it would be cool but it leaves a lot of room for open ended ideas which is nice but at the same time can be hard to produce work that goes towards a general goal. If I were to Take this option I would do the same thing that I would for all the other projects. Just take it slow and produce quality work.
