Hello World! Im Sam and i get the pleasure of sharing my journey through my english 235 class!

My initial understanding of technical writing was that really boring text that you tend to eaither throw away right as you open something new or that huge booklet that you keep just incase but never actually look at ever agian. But I soon found out that i wasnt wrong i was just forgetting a huge part of technical writing which is litterly the explination to anything that you buy dowload... ect. which I had no idea!
